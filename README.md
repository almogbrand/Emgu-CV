# Emgu-CV

fff

A windows forms app that allows user to apply Emgu filters on uploaded image. 
(Emgu CV is a cross platform .Net wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library)

List on the left shows all available methods to apply on the image.
List on the right shows the applied methods by order (drag & drop to apply).

Big image on the top right corner shows the end result - image with all methods by order 

Mouse on the blue line (under each chosen method on the right list) will show the result untill that point

yet to come - study canny \ soble \ threshold and others in order to detect shapes in an image. 
later on - develop algorithms for detection of a rotated \ scaled shape.
